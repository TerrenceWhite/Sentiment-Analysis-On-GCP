# Sentiment-Analysis-On-GCP
This project explores two services available on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for performing sentiment analysis: Natural Language API and AutoML Natural Language. The former provides powerful prebuilt models that can be invoked as a service allowing developers to perform sentiment analysis, along with other features like entity analysis, content classification, and syntax analysis. The latter allows developers to train more domain specific models whenever the pre-trained models offered by the Natural Language API are not sufficient. Experiments have been conducted with both of these offerings and the results are presented herein.
